<h2>Lighter Than Air</h2>

<p>It's new iPhone season, and as I do most years, I awoke at 5 AM to pre-order my new iPhone a few Fridays ago. The pre-order process was the easiest I've ever experienced: I had the order confirmed by 5:02 AM, and I was back in bed by 5:05 AM.</p>

<p>So of course the universe had to intervene.</p>

<p>I waited all day for UPS, and finally at 6:27 PM the UPS truck arrived at my home and delivered the package. I signed for it and went inside. Immediately my Spider-Sense went off—something felt <em>wrong</em>. Holding the box, my first thought was it felt very light. <em>Well, it's the iPhone Air, of course it's light</em>, I thought, but I knew that was wrong. Then I looked closer at the packaging.</p>

<p>If you've ever ordered direct from Apple, you know from delivery box to product in hand, scissors are not required. Every box opens with easy pull tabs. This box was taped. Beneath the tape, the pull tab was missing. The box had been opened and resealed.</p>

<p>I should have stopped here and chased down the UPS driver but I grabbed my knife, already knowing what I'd find in the box: air. And not the iPhone kind.</p>

<p>The box contained some corrugated cardboard padding, a shipping invoice, and the return shipping box for the trade-in. The iPhone Air was gone.</p>

<p>I ran outside but the UPS driver was already turning the corner. I grabbed my keys and jumped in my car, and followed him down the street to his next stop. I waved him down, walked over to his truck, and showed him the box. He seemed to recognize the signs of tampering immediately. We talked, he made some calls, and he said I should call Apple and UPS to file a claim.</p>

<p>As I waited on hold for Apple, I submitted my claim to UPS. Apple customer support was incredible. The agent I spoke to was kind, apologetic, and was truly sorry for something she nor Apple had any control over or fault in. She took my info and I received a simple email a short time later: "We're checking on your delivery."</p>

<p>A few days later I received another email from Apple that said, "We're replacing your items." On Wednesday, UPS returned with my iPhone Air, this time in the shipping box. Apple overnighted it. Classy.</p>

<p>Big thanks to Apple for taking care of me and replacing the iPhone so quickly. Everyone I spoke to was professional and sympathetic.</p>

<p>Now that I have my iPhone Air, I want to spend a few days with it before I start writing about it, but I can say this: it is incredibly thin. The camera plateau is a little bulky, but it's incredible that an entire computer is housed in that little bump.</p>

<p>I think my iPhone Air review will start with something like, "If you want to know what the future feels like, pick up an iPhone Air…"</p>

<h2>MacOS Tahoe Thoughts</h2>

<p>I updated to macOS Tahoe last week. A few brief thoughts.</p>

<p>Love the name. Love the screensaver. Love the wallpapers. Tahoe might be my favorite place in the world—beautiful, relaxing, and for years it was just a short drive away. Like a second home.</p>

<p>Still undecided on Liquid Glass. I’ve been on the iOS beta for a few months, but my Mac is the device I rely on, so I waited for the full release. Liquid Glass is easier to tolerate on macOS, but not without some quirks. Safari tabs need work. The Finder icon looks bad. Some apps need to finally update their icons for Dark Mode. The Finder sidebar is awkward, especially where it butts against the bottom status bar. Honestly, the whole sidebar feels off.<p>

<p>Steve was the final say on every button, switch, Finder window, and icon. And more than that, he cared how it looked. Liquid Glass makes it clear Apple needs someone to fill this role again—a design director with final cut. Walt Disney, Steven Spielberg, Steve Jobs—visionaries with the trust and authority to ensure a coherent, complete vision. You get those once in a generation, if you‘re lucky. Apple without Steve feels more like Windows under Microsoft: guesswork and <em>g‘nuff</em>.</p>

<p>New Spotlight seems powerful but I‘m still getting familiar with all of the power user features. The best part of Spotlight is if you‘re used to simply using Command-Space to open an app, that hasn‘t changed. But now, not only can Spotlight quickly find a Shortcut, you can set a custom character sequence for next time. My ”Sleep Now” shortcut runs with Command-Space, z. And from testing, it appears that shortcut gets priority over an app like Zoom, which now requires ”zo” to open. Not bad for an Apple-made utility.</p>

<p>But the volume indicator? For 25 years, its home was at the bottom center of the screen. Now its too far away, too small, and too transparent. It‘s just too much.</p>

<p>My new iPhone Air was stolen in transit with UPS. I hope to have something to say about that, and the phone itself, in a few days.</p>

<h2>The Silver Surfer Genderswap</h2>

<p>The new <em>Fantastic Four</em> movie hasn't been released yet, but I keep thinking about it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAsmrKyMqaA">the moment Julia Garner descended from the sky in the first trailer</a>, silver-skinned and solemn, was beautiful. <em>Stunning</em>. <strong>Cinematic.</strong></p>

<p>I adore Julia Garner. And when I saw her as the Herald of Galactus, it hit me: of all the superheroes they chose to draw essentially naked, they picked a glistening chrome <em>dude</em> surfing through the cosmos. The embodiment of overt, toxic masculinity packaged for little boys and grown men alike. I knew two things from that trailer: the Silver Surfer as a woman was sexy and powerful and <em>right</em>—and the backlash would be predictable and dumb.</p>

<p>It‘s the usual whine from men who think a fictional alien needs a penis for the plot. The same shallow voices. The ones who recoil at women in boardrooms, classrooms, and voting booths. The problem isn’t Julia Garner (or Brie Larson, or Iman Vellani, or Sasha Calle, or Leslie Grace, or Xochitl Gomez, etc.). It’s not about source material. It’s not even about fandom. It’s about control—who has it, and who’s allowed to be seen with it.</p>

<p>For decades, the superhero has been a fantasy designed for men, built around masculine ideals like stoicism, ego, dominance, and a heavy dose of unresolved mommy issues. When those power roles are given freely to someone else—a woman, a person of color, a queer character—it’s not seen as inclusion. It’s trespassing.</p>

<p>For some, characters like the Silver Surfer or Superman aren’t just comic book icons. They’re identity anchors. Symbols people tattoo on their bodies and stick on their cars. So when that symbol shifts—when a woman embodies that cosmic power and strikes that mythic pose—they take it as a threat to their status as <em>the default</em>. The white, masculine, heteronormative daydream they’ve built around these heroes no longer centers on <em>them</em>.</p>

<p>When Julia Garner descends from the sky, wrapped in silver, they won’t admit what really bothers them: that a woman is holding power—cosmic, cultural, political—and refusing to apologize for it.</p>

<p>But isn’t that the point of the genre? That anyone—regardless of body, origin, or backstory—can become something more? It’s funny how we can read the same comic book, watch the same movie, but where some want to share the story with everyone, others were never taught to share.</p>

<p>When asked about the so-called “fans” who think only a man should play the role, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/fantastic-four-julia-garner-backlash-silver-surfer-1236458924/">Julia simply said</a>: “I’m just going to still do my job.” That’s the answer. She doesn’t owe them an argument. She’s already surfing the stars. And there’s room up there for all of us.</p>

<h2>HBO‘s The Last of Us Season 2 Was Very, Very Bad</h2>

<p><em>This post contains spoilers for The Last of Us Part I, Part II, and especially the TV show.</em></p>

<p>I’m a fan of <em>The Last of Us</em>—the games, not the show. The games are fun, they have strong emotional beats, and they’re linear in a way that allows for structured storytelling and interesting character dialogue and cutscenes. But the TV show on HBO is badly written. It doesn’t seem to understand Ellie as an adult, getting her tone and dialogue wrong. It’s not developing Ellie as a strong, intelligent, independent woman, and when she decides to leave Dina in pursuit of Abby, audiences are going to be confused. And where are all the infected? So let’s talk about it.</p>

<h3>Ellie’s Descent Lacks Weight</h3>

<p>In the game, Ellie’s journey is marked by increasingly brutal choices—stabbing, improvised explosives, and arrows to the head. These moments aren’t just action—they’re character. By limiting her on-screen kills and softening key moments, the show undermines the gradual erosion of Ellie’s morality. This may make her future decisions—assuming they remain somewhat consistent with the game—difficult to justify.</p>

<p>In the show, Ellie often comes off as impulsive, unfocused, and strangely detached from the mission she claims to care about. She rushes into danger, is rude and obnoxious, and displays little of the instinct needed to survive in a world of <em>Cordyceps</em>. Scenes with her joking, “I’m going to be a dad” and quipping about protractors and math, undercut any real urgency. Her motivations are inconsistent: she tells Dina she’ll turn back, only for Dina to insist they push on—then an episode later, Jesse wants to turn back, but Ellie refuses. The writing undercuts her conviction at every turn.</p>

<p>When torturing Nora, Bella Ramsey plays Ellie with a cold, emotionless detachment that reads more like sociopathy than inner conflict. Compare that to the game, where Ellie visibly wrestles with what she’s doing—her hesitation, her struggle, her knowledge that this is wrong, and her conviction that she’s going to do it anyways. The animators and actor Ashley Johnson made Ellie’s guilt and resolve believable; the show skips the complexity and paints her as hollow.</p>

<p>Then there’s Alice, the WLF-trained dog Ellie kills in a quick, brutal moment. Players will only realize her significance playing as Abby. Alice‘s death is a powerful beat the show completely omits. This isn’t just a missed moment of pathos—it’s evidence of the show’s broader failure to challenge the audience’s view of Ellie as the hero.</p>

<p>Ellie is meant to have earned the respect and friendship of Dina and Jesse, but the show strips her of complexity, personality, and basic likability. She feels increasingly unfit for the path she’s on, making her eventual abandonment of Dina and JJ—and her survival and vengeance in Santa Barbara—feel unearned and implausible.</p>

<h3>The Joel Flashback Is Compressed and Ineffective</h3>

<p>Flashbacks from the game—such as Ellie learning the truth about her uniqueness, confronting Joel about the events in Salt Lake City, and beginning the process of forgiveness—are combined into a single, rushed scene during the show. In the game, these moments are spaced out, giving Ellie and the player time to process, reflect, and emotionally react.</p>

<p>Often in adaptations, shows are constrained by a budget or episode count that forces compromises from the source material, but <em>The Last of Us</em> is clearly exempt from these restraints. So much time has already been wasted filling out pointless scenes early in the season in Jackson, or cutting scenes from Seattle, that season 2 is already two episodes shorter than the previous season. There‘s no justification for rushing these final flashbacks.</p>

<p>And as written for the show, this new combined scene just doesn’t work. Ellie already knows Joel has been lying—she says so earlier in the episode. Forcing him to admit it again on the porch adds nothing. What we’re left with is a flattened, rushed attempt at resolution, written by someone who either doesn’t understand or doesn’t care what made these scenes in the game so unforgettable.</p>

<h3>The Infected Are Practically Absent</h3>

<p>Season 2 significantly downplays the infected threat. Seattle in the game is crawling with Runners, Clickers, Stalkers, Shamblers, and Bloaters. In the show, the infected are nearly nonexistent. I know from Season 1 the showrunners don’t like using the infected unless absolutely necessary, but there were moments where the show spent a lot of time setting up dead ends, like the Jackson town council speech and Ellie and Dina’s teen dramedy subplots that could have made for a great Shambler attack instead. The horror and survival elements that define <em>The Last of Us</em> are almost entirely stripped out, reducing the atmosphere to a post-apocalyptic romantic drama with little sense of physical danger.</p>

<h3>Addendum</h3>

<p><strong>Time Wasted in Jackson:</strong> Delaying Joel’s death, the scenes with the therapist, the town council scene—all absurd. Sure, they wanted to get their money’s worth out of the Jackson sets, but this is all pointless wheel spinning. The game knows where the story starts—Seattle.</p>

<p><strong>Seth’s Redemption Arc:</strong> Unnecessary and gross, plus they cut the “bigot sandwich” line—one of the best lines in the game. Seth never needed a redemption subplot. He exists solely to trigger the confrontation between Ellie and Joel. Sometimes a bigot is just a bigot.</p>

<p><strong>Mel’s Death Scene:</strong> After Ellie accidentally shoots Mel, the show drags out her death with a bizarre request to cut out the baby. What in the bad writing is going on with this show?</p>

<p><strong>The Immunity Reveal to Dina:</strong> Another scene that overstays its welcome. Ellie drops the immunity reveal like she’s announcing the McDonald’s shake machine is broken again. Dina holds a gun on Ellie all night for no reason. It’s established it takes hours to turn. The audience knows there is zero suspense here. In the game, Dina learns the truth during a Clicker rush, sparing players a tedious exposition dump—I assume she got the full story later.</p>

<p><strong>Season 3:</strong> Abby’s relationship with Owen, Mel, and Lev are some of the most complex and sensitive scenes in the game, requiring a deft touch and subtlety that Season 2 has severely lacked. I do not think writer Craig Mazin has the skill or depth required to adapt these scenes to television, and I fear many of these criticisms will carry over into future seasons of the show.</p>

<p><strong>And Part III:</strong> C‘mon, Naughty Dog, we need this.</p>

<h2>Thanks, Target</h2>
<p>I pre-ordered my Switch 2 from Target because they were promising release-day delivery. But as delivery day approached, my Switch 2 didn‘t ship, and it was eventually delivered about three days later than originally promised.</p>

<p>I just shrugged and went about my life, because there wasn‘t anything I could do about that. But I guess enough people complained, so Target sent me a $50 Nintendo eShop Gift Card.</p>

<p>I have to admit, I suspected this was a scam until I made a quick Kagi search. Turns out the gift card is real.</p>

<p>I‘m not sure what I‘ll spend my card on. And while I really do appreciate Target‘s acknowledgment that this wasn‘t the ”experience we intended,” I hope they also acknowledge some other <a href="https://www.pride.com/target-pride-collection-2025">lackluster and disappointing experiences in their stores</a>, as well.</p>

<h2>Three Weeks</h2>
<p>We are three weeks away from new episodes of <em>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</em>. It‘s been almost two full years since Hegemony, the season two finale. I really like the series, although I have some complaints.</p>

<p>Speaking of Hegemony, I just need to nitpick that final scene of the episode. A mostly great episode— Spock taking on a Gorn in zero-g, Scotty joining the crew, some nice Shuttlecrafting by Ortegas, and then Pike… Spock tells him the crew and colonists have been beamed up by the Gorn, the Gorn are attacking the Enterprise, and Pike just stares dumbstruck at his bridge crew. Now, I know this was for cliffhanger suspense purposes, fine. But that scene went on for about ten seconds too long. Pike doesn‘t strike me as indecisive. Every great captain has been in this situation, we all know the play: You hit warp 8, get out of there, and come back for your people. You don‘t make Captain by standing on your bridge with your mouth open.</p>

<p>Speaking of things we know: the futures of almost everyone on that ship. There are only a few characters, like La‘An Noonien-Singh and Erica Ortegas, whose futures we don‘t know, except that those futures do not exist on Kirk‘s Enterprise. (If La‘An doesn‘t make some ”heroic” final episode sacrifice, I‘ll be shocked.) We also know that Chapel and Spock won‘t have a future together, nor will La‘An and Kirk. It‘s frustrating having the series set up these doomed relationships, but that‘s canon!</p>

<p>Paramount also announced that there will be only 26 more episodes of <em>Strange New Worlds</em>: season 3, 4, and 5 with the final season consisting of only 6 episodes. That makes <em>Strange New Worlds</em> one of the shortest Star Trek series with fewer episodes than Enterprise, Discovery, or Lower Decks.</p>

<p>I also love every scene Paul Wesley is in as Kirk. He‘s not William Shatner, but he absolutely <em>is</em> James T. Kirk, and no I can‘t explain it.</p>

<h2>First Post</h2>
<p>The blog is back, although this time it‘ll be more of a personal writing space that a news blog. If I haven‘t written anything yet, you can click or tap the upper left corner‘s hamburger menu for links to some of my previous articles and essays. Some of them are pretty good. Also, I don‘t have an RSS feed, because everything on GitHub Sites is static. If I was cooler I‘d be making YouTube videos or at least TikToks…</p>
