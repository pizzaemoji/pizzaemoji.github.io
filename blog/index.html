<h2>Structural Failures in HBO‘s The Last of Us Season 2</h2>

<p><em>This post contains spoilers for The Last of Us Part I, Part II, and especially the TV show.</em></p>

<p>I’m a fan of <em>The Last of Us</em>—the games, not the show. The games are fun, they have strong emotional beats, and they’re linear in a way that allows for structured storytelling and interesting character dialogue and cutscenes. But the TV show on HBO is badly written. It doesn’t seem to understand Ellie as an adult, getting her tone and dialogue wrong. It’s not developing Ellie as a strong, intelligent, independent woman, and when she decides to leave Dina in pursuit of Abby, audiences are going to be confused. And where are all the infected? So let’s talk about it.</p>

<h3>Ellie’s Descent Lacks Weight</h3>

<p>In the game, Ellie’s journey is marked by increasingly brutal choices—stabbing, improvised explosives, and arrows to the head. These moments aren’t just action—they’re character. By limiting her on-screen kills and softening key moments, the show undermines the gradual erosion of Ellie’s morality. This may make her future decisions—assuming they remain somewhat consistent with the game—difficult to justify.</p>

<p>In the show, Ellie often comes off as impulsive, unfocused, and strangely detached from the mission she claims to care about. She rushes into danger, is rude and obnoxious, and displays little of the instinct needed to survive in a world of <em>Cordyceps</em>. Scenes with her joking, “I’m going to be a dad” and quipping about protractors and math, undercut any real urgency. Her motivations are inconsistent: she tells Dina she’ll turn back, only for Dina to insist they push on—then an episode later, Jesse wants to turn back, but Ellie refuses. The writing undercuts her conviction at every turn.</p>

<p>When torturing Nora, Bella Ramsey plays Ellie with a cold, emotionless detachment that reads more like sociopathy than inner conflict. Compare that to the game, where Ellie visibly wrestles with what she’s doing—her hesitation, her struggle, her knowledge that this is wrong, and her conviction that she’s going to do it anyways. The animators and actor Ashley Johnson made Ellie’s guilt and resolve believable; the show skips the complexity and paints her as hollow.</p>

<p>Then there’s Alice, the WLF-trained dog Ellie kills in a quick, brutal moment. Players will only realize her significance playing as Abby. Alice‘s death is a powerful beat the show completely omits. This isn’t just a missed moment of pathos—it’s evidence of the show’s broader failure to challenge the audience’s view of Ellie as the hero.</p>

<p>Ellie is meant to have earned the respect and friendship of Dina and Jesse, but the show strips her of complexity, personality, and basic likability. She feels increasingly unfit for the path she’s on, making her eventual abandonment of Dina and JJ—and her survival and vengeance in Santa Barbara—feel unearned and implausible.</p>

<h3>The Joel Flashback Is Compressed and Ineffective</h3>

<p>Flashbacks from the game—such as Ellie learning the truth about her uniqueness, confronting Joel about the events in Salt Lake City, and beginning the process of forgiveness—are combined into a single, rushed scene during the show. In the game, these moments are spaced out, giving Ellie and the player time to process, reflect, and emotionally react.</p>

<p>Often in adaptations, shows are constrained by a budget or episode count that forces compromises from the source material, but <em>The Last of Us</em> is clearly exempt from these restraints. So much time has already been wasted filling out pointless scenes early in the season in Jackson, or cutting scenes from Seattle, that season 2 is already two episodes shorter than the previous season. There‘s no justification for rushing these final flashbacks.</p>

<p>And as written for the show, this new combined scene just doesn’t work. Ellie already knows Joel has been lying—she says so earlier in the episode. Forcing him to admit it again on the porch adds nothing. What we’re left with is a flattened, rushed attempt at resolution, written by someone who either doesn’t understand or doesn’t care what made these scenes in the game so unforgettable.</p>

<h3>The Infected Are Practically Absent</h3>

<p>Season 2 significantly downplays the infected threat. Seattle in the game is crawling with Runners, Clickers, Stalkers, Shamblers, and Bloaters. In the show, the infected are nearly nonexistent. I know from Season 1 the showrunners don’t like using the infected unless absolutely necessary, but there were moments where the show spent a lot of time setting up dead ends, like the Jackson town council speech and Ellie and Dina’s teen dramedy subplots that could have made for a great Shambler attack instead. The horror and survival elements that define <em>The Last of Us</em> are almost entirely stripped out, reducing the atmosphere to a post-apocalyptic romantic drama with little sense of physical danger.</p>

<h3>Addendum</h3>

<p><strong>Time Wasted in Jackson:</strong> Delaying Joel’s death, the scenes with the therapist, the town council scene—all absurd. Sure, they wanted to get their money’s worth out of the Jackson sets, but this is all pointless wheel spinning. The game knows where the story starts—Seattle.</p>

<p><strong>Seth’s Redemption Arc:</strong> Unnecessary and gross, plus they cut the “bigot sandwich” line—one of the best lines in the game. Seth never needed a redemption subplot. He exists solely to trigger the confrontation between Ellie and Joel. Sometimes a bigot is just a bigot.</p>

<p><strong>Mel’s Death Scene:</strong> After Ellie accidentally shoots Mel, the show drags out her death with a bizarre request to cut out the baby. What in the bad writing is going on with this show?</p>

<p><strong>The Immunity Reveal to Dina:</strong> Another scene that overstays its welcome. Ellie drops the immunity reveal like she’s announcing the McDonald’s shake machine is broken again. Dina holds a gun on Ellie all night for no reason. It’s established it takes hours to turn. The audience knows there is zero suspense here. In the game, Dina learns the truth during a Clicker rush, sparing players a tedious exposition dump—I assume she got the full story later.</p>

<p><strong>Season 3:</strong> Abby’s relationship with Owen, Mel, and Lev are some of the most complex and sensitive scenes in the game, requiring a deft touch and subtlety that Season 2 has severely lacked. I do not think writer Craig Mazin has the skill or depth required to adapt these scenes to television, and I fear many of these criticisms will carry over into future seasons of the show.</p>

<p><strong>And Part III:</strong> C'mon, Naughty Dog, we need this.</p>

<h2>Thanks, Target</h2>
<p>I pre-ordered my Switch 2 from Target because they were promising release-day delivery. But as delivery day approached, my Switch 2 didn‘t ship, and it was eventually delivered about three days later than originally promised.</p>

<p>I just shrugged and went about my life, because there wasn‘t anything I could do about that. But I guess enough people complained, so Target sent me a $50 Nintendo eShop Gift Card.</p>

<p>I have to admit, I suspected this was a scam until I made a quick Kagi search. Turns out the gift card is real.</p>

<p>I‘m not sure what I‘ll spend my card on. And while I really do appreciate Target‘s acknowledgment that this wasn‘t the ”experience we intended,” I hope they also acknowledge some other <a href="https://www.pride.com/target-pride-collection-2025">lackluster and disappointing experiences in their stores</a>, as well.</p>

<h2>Three Weeks</h2>
<p>We are three weeks away from new episodes of <em>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</em>. It‘s been almost two full years since Hegemony, the season two finale. I really like the series, although I have some complaints.</p>

<p>Speaking of Hegemony, I just need to nitpick that final scene of the episode. A mostly great episode— Spock taking on a Gorn in zero-g, Scotty joining the crew, some nice Shuttlecrafting by Ortegas, and then Pike… Spock tells him the crew and colonists have been beamed up by the Gorn, the Gorn are attacking the Enterprise, and Pike just stares dumbstruck at his bridge crew. Now, I know this was for cliffhanger suspense purposes, fine. But that scene went on for about ten seconds too long. Pike doesn‘t strike me as indecisive. Every great captain has been in this situation, we all know the play: You hit warp 8, get out of there, and come back for your people. You don‘t make Captain by standing on your bridge with your mouth open.</p>

<p>Speaking of things we know: the futures of almost everyone on that ship. There are only a few characters, like La‘An Noonien-Singh and Erica Ortegas, whose futures we don‘t know, except that those futures do not exist on Kirk‘s Enterprise. (If La‘An doesn‘t make some ”heroic” final episode sacrifice, I‘ll be shocked.) We also know that Chapel and Spock won‘t have a future together, nor will La‘An and Kirk. It‘s frustrating having the series set up these doomed relationships, but that‘s canon!</p>

<p>Paramount also announced that there will be only 26 more episodes of <em>Strange New Worlds</em>: season 3, 4, and 5 with the final season consisting of only 6 episodes. That makes <em>Strange New Worlds</em> one of the shortest Star Trek series with fewer episodes than Enterprise, Discovery, or Lower Decks.</p>

<p>I also love every scene Paul Wesley is in as Kirk. He‘s not William Shatner, but he absolutely <em>is</em> James T. Kirk, and no I can‘t explain it.</p>

<h2>First Post</h2>
<p>The blog is back, although this time it‘ll be more of a personal writing space that a news blog. If I haven‘t written anything yet, you can click or tap the upper left corner‘s hamburger menu for links to some of my previous articles and essays. Some of them are pretty good. Also, I don‘t have an RSS feed, because everything on GitHub Sites is static. If I was cooler I‘d be making YouTube videos or at least TikToks…</p>
