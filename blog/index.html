<h3>Thanks, Target</h3>
<p>I pre-ordered my Switch 2 from Target because they were promising release-day delivery. But as delivery day approached, my Switch 2 didn't ship, and it was eventually delivered about three days later than originally promised.</p>

<p>I just shrugged and went about my life, because there wasn't anything I could do about that. But I guess enough people complained, so Target sent me a $50 Nintendo eShop Gift Card.</p>

<p>I have to admit, I suspected this was a scam until I made a quick Kagi search. Turns out the gift card is real.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what I'll spend my card on. And while I really do appreciate Target's acknowledgment that this wasn't the "experience we intended," I hope they also acknowledge some other <a href="https://www.pride.com/target-pride-collection-2025">lackluster and disappointing experiences in their stores</a>, as well.</p>

<h3>Three Weeks</h3>
<p>We are three weeks away from new episodes of <em>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</em>. It‘s been almost two full years since Hegemony, the season two finale. I really like the series, although I have some complaints.</p>

<p>Speaking of Hegemony, I just need to nitpick that final scene of the episode. A mostly great episode— Spock taking on a Gorn in zero-g, Scotty joining the crew, some nice Shuttlecrafting by Ortegas, and then Pike… Spock tells him the crew and colonists have been beamed up by the Gorn, the Gorn are attacking the Enterprise, and Pike just stares dumbstruck at his bridge crew. Now, I know this was for cliffhanger suspense purposes, fine. But that scene went on for about ten seconds too long. Pike doesn‘t strike me as indecisive. Every great captain has been in this situation, we all know the play: You hit warp 8, get out of there, and come back for your people. You don‘t make Captain by standing on your bridge with your mouth open.</p>

<p>Speaking of things we know: the futures of almost everyone on that ship. There are only a few characters, like La‘An Noonien-Singh and Erica Ortegas, whose futures we don‘t know, except that those futures do not exist on Kirk‘s Enterprise. (If La‘An doesn‘t make some ”heroic” final episode sacrifice, I‘ll be shocked.) We also know that Chapel and Spock won‘t have a future together, nor will La‘An and Kirk. It‘s frustrating having the series set up these doomed relationships, but that‘s canon!</p>

<p>Paramount also announced that there will be only 26 more episodes of <em>Strange New Worlds</em>: season 3, 4, and 5 with the final season consisting of only 6 episodes. That makes <em>Strange New Worlds</em> one of the shortest Star Trek series with fewer episodes than Enterprise, Discovery, or Lower Decks.</p>

<p>I also love every scene Paul Wesley is in as Kirk. He‘s not William Shatner, but he absolutely <em>is</em> James T. Kirk, and no I can‘t explain it.</p>

<h3>A little CSS later…</h3>
<p>I now have, what appears to be, a new blog. The sidebar holds a couple of links to the newest Big Posts/Features (I don‘t have a name for those yet) and this is just a space separated by section tags. Pretty basic but it looks okay and gets the job done, I think.</p>

<h3>First Post</h3>
<p>I‘m trying to decide if it‘s feasible to relaunch the blog. For now, this will be a sporaidcally (at best) updated space.</p>
