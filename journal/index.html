<p>Returned from SoCal. I've been mostly watching shows and YouTube as I recover from a very tiring vacation. I've also been tasked with administrating the medication for my roommate's sick cat. She is a very sweet cat, but she does not like taking her pills. Twice a day we fight and it is tiring. He will be back from his vacation in two weeks. I think when he gets back, I'm going to Tahoe.</p>

<p>Well, it took another day but I think the formatting is cleaned up. I even made myself a little logo to keep the nav a little neater looking. And I stuck my Memoji up there to even it all out.</p>

<p>That'll do, pig. That'll do.</p>

<p>Tomorrow I'll be leaving for SoCal…

<p>Been working on some HTML projects. And doing some writing.<p>

<p>Creating this journal was fun, even though I'm a terrible journaler. Journaling usually feels like a chore, but I do think it's beneficial to just write, so I'll give this a shot.</p>

<p>Still trying to get all the CSS formatting just right...</p>
